<p>I had no clue it was this <strong>easy</strong> to get started on blogging. Untill now, I had thought it would be a pain to configure a website just for blogs, as that would take a lot of resources and time that I would probably not have 2 days before a semester exam.</p>
<p>The config of a theme, the HTML and CSS styling, understanding how to configure the posts in a clear way in my database, all seemed too challenging. However, I did want to <em>START</em>. It&rsquo;s been a long time in my mind that I wanted to share my thoughts as I study through the various interlacing trenches of Web Development, Data Science and CyberSec.</p>
<h3 id="alternatives">Alternatives</h3>
<p>The other options would have been to go on sites like Medium and Quora, but then I would probably get locked into the site, and god knows I have had too many times getting caught doomscrolling on Insta, I didnt need to add <strong>another</strong> site to the list.</p>
<h3 id="solution">Solution</h3>
<p>So finally! Hugo! Took me 30 minutes to setup, and its up and running already! Looking forward to posting interesting news, Stay tuned!</p>
