### Introduction

I had no clue it was this **easy** to get started on blogging. Untill now, I had thought it would be a pain to configure a website just for blogs, as that would take a lot of resources and time that I would probably not have 2 days before a semester exam.

The config of a theme, the HTML and CSS styling, understanding how to configure the posts in a clear way in my database, all seemed too challenging. However, I did want to _START_. It's been a long time in my mind that I wanted to share my thoughts as I study through the various interlacing trenches of Web Development, Data Science and CyberSec.

### Alternatives
The other options would have been to go on sites like Medium and Quora, but then I would probably get locked into the site, and god knows I have had too many times getting caught doomscrolling on Insta, I didnt need to add **another** site to the list.

### Solution

So finally! Hugo my man! Took me 30 minutes to setup, and its up and running already! Looking forward to posting interesting news, Stay tuned!
